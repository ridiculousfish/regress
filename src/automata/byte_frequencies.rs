//! A static byte-frequency rank, used only to pick which bytes to anchor a
//! case-insensitive packed-pair search on (see `casefold_search`).
//!
//! `rank(b)` is higher for bytes that occur more often in typical text, so a
//! *lower* rank means a *rarer* byte — a better anchor (its candidate hits are
//! sparse, so the verify step runs rarely). This is the same data-driven table
//! shipped by `aho-corasick`/`regex`/`memchr`; it replaces the crude
//! lowercase-vs-not heuristic the literal prefilter used to gate on.

/// Byte-frequency ranks: `BYTE_FREQUENCIES[b]` ∈ `0..=255`, higher = more common.
